#### As a customer, I want to:

1. Log a new request with a title, description, and category, and optionally add attachments.
2. Receive an email or notification acknowledging that my request has been logged.
3. View the status of my requests, including the ticket number, title, and disposition of the request.
4. Add comments to my request and view previous comments from agents.
5. Resolve a request if I am satisfied with the solution provided by the agent.
6. Re-open a request if I am not satisfied with the solution provided by the agent.

#### As an agent, I want to:

1. Receive customer requests.
2. Log each request against the customer's profile with a ticket number, title, description, and category.
3. Update the disposition of each ticket according to the workflow (open, in-progress, blocked, resolved, re-opened, closed).
4. Log follow-up comments against each ticket in reverse chronological order
